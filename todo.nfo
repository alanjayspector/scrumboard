1. check for datetime types in python and datetime bultin functions or packages  DONE!
2. had fun with subclasses dict for card.py but it maybe time move this from being a dict subclass to just an class with attributes
3. make datetime test on cardtest actually mean something
4. generators for cardID, personID, sprintID, scrumboardID
5. should scrumboard.cards and scrumboard.people be associated arrays? Need to check best practices for this
