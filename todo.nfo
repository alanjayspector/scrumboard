1. check for datetime types in python and datetime bultin functions or packages  DONE!
2. had fun with subclasses dict for card.py but it maybe time move this from being a dict subclass to just an class with attributes
3. make datetime test on cardtest actually mean something
4. generators for cardID, personID, sprintID, scrumboardID -- Done! Hello @staticmethod
5. should scrumboard.cards and scrumboard.people be lists or dictionaries ? Need to check best practices for this. --- I'm think sets for this!
